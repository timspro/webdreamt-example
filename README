This is an example of WebDreamt project.

To install, just drop the project in your Apache's web root and run Composer to install the dependencies.

You will want to change:
$this->DatabaseUsername = 'root';
$this->DatabasePassword = '';
$this->DatabaseName = 'webdreamt_blog';
$this->DatabaseHost = 'localhost';
in src/Box.php to your database values.

You will also want to change:
$user = $sentry->createUser([
	'email' => 'admin@admin.com',
	'password' => 'password',
		]);
in web/admin/setup.php to an email and password of your choosing.
You will also want to check that your file permissions are correct for your server to make files.
If you are unsure, you will want to run:
"chmod -R 755 ." (or "chmod -R 777")
in a shell that has been navigated to the root of your project.

Then, navigate to localhost/webdreamt-example/admin/setup.php in your browser. This creates the first
user and the default group and the admin group with permissions. You should see "Configuration completed."
in your browser.

Now, you should able to login at localhost/webdreamt-example/login.php with the email and password
you set above.
