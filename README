This is an example of WebDreamt project.

To install, just drop the project in your Apache's web root and run Composer to install the dependencies.

You will want to change:
$this->DatabaseUsername = 'root';
$this->DatabasePassword = '';
$this->DatabaseName = 'webdreamt_blog';
$this->DatabaseHost = 'localhost';
in src/Box.php to your database values.

You will also want to change:
$user = $sentry->createUser([
	'email' => 'admin@admin.com',
	'password' => 'password',
		]);
in web/admin/setup.php to an email and password of your choosing.

Then, navigate to localhost/webdreamt-example/admin/setup.php in your browser. This creates the first
user and the default group and the admin group with permissions.

Now, you should able to login at localhost/webdreamt-example/login.php with the email and password
you set above.
